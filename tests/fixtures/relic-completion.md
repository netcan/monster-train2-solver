# Remaining original relic coverage

User objective: finish original collectible relic coverage, with small commits
after each independently validated batch. The accepted owner table remains
[relic-coverage.md](relic-coverage.md); the exact 224-owner checklist is
[relic-inventory.tsv](relic-inventory.tsv). A pending row is not evidence.

The complete native catalog was refreshed on 2026-10-17 with
`Run-FullBattleProbe.ps1 -RelicCatalog -BinaryCapture -GameSpeed Instant -SkipBuild`.
It contains 662 definitions from eight collections, including 224 unique
collectible relics, with identical native frame/RNG before and after enumeration.
All 224 owners have local source files in `.game-reference/native-source/`.
Catalog path:
`.probe-runs/full-battle-no-cards-20261017-062824-ae5e430a/relic-catalog.mt2f`.
Schema 8 retains the required card traits introduced in schema 6.

Regenerate the checklist with `scripts/Get-RelicCoverageInventory.ps1 -Catalog
<relic-catalog.mt2f> -OutputPath tests/fixtures/relic-inventory.tsv`. This verifies
catalog identity, unique owner IDs, accepted table identities and source presence.
Current checkpoint: 155 original owners accepted (139 native battle owners,
fifteen actual campaign-interface owners and one explicit native no-op owner);
69 remain pending. The latest accepted native battle owner is
`PyreRevengeAddPyregel`: four live Pyre OnHit callbacks match complete-train
Tower target order and remote +2 Pyregel writeback. Campaign acceptance
does not imply those effect classes are integrated into battle branch state.

Acceptance requires an unchanged original owner, actual eligible and control
paths, exact model/native state and relevant ordering/callback checks. Battle
effects need a winning native capture with zero error counters, independent
policy replay or explicit replay of every recorded action and turn transition,
and affected-fixture regression. Merchant/reward/draft effects
need their actual campaign lifecycle evidence; definition enumeration and
inert battle presence do not validate those effects. Pure no-op definitions
must be explicitly identified without inventing activation evidence.
