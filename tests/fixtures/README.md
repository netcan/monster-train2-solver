# Native regression fixtures

These fixed inputs reproduce the independently modeled battle and calibration
checks. Run `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Check-Models.ps1` from the repository
root. The script reads the curated fixture list in this directory.

The retained inputs are `.mt2f` binary archives. They store typed, deduplicated
value graphs, not JSON documents. Regression reads those graphs and constructs
model states directly. Every captured value is preserved; identical repeated
states share storage. See `src/FixtureArchive/FORMAT.md` for the versioned layout.

`manifest.tsv` records the original capture length/SHA-256 and each archive's
length/SHA-256. The regression script verifies its complete curated inventory
and archive hashes before running. `SIMULATION.md` records native coverage and
capture versions; historical JSON/gzip paths there describe the original inputs
before the binary migration. Import verification compares all values, exact
number lexemes, property order and duplicate keys; JSON whitespace and escape
spelling are not part of the retained representation.

Direct native archives use a `native:` source label and zero text-source
length/SHA-256, because no source JSON document exists. Their binary payload and
complete archive hashes still protect integrity. The capture records the game
version and module MVID; optional diagnostic JSON is used only for independent
value comparison.

`results/` is ignored and holds local logs, catalogs and benchmark outputs.
Isolated native probes use `.probe-runs/`, which is also ignored. Successful
captures become fixed inputs here after native and independent comparisons pass.

`full-battle-status-callbacks.mt2f` retains the complete schema 46 native battle
and 481 ordered status callback dispatches, including zero additions, actual
removals, silence loss and dying actors. These checks compare captured native
unit/context states independently of the predictions stored in the capture.
