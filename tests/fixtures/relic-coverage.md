# Original relic coverage evidence

As of 2026-10-11, **16 distinct original collectable relics / 224 catalog entries
(7.14%)** have accepted native full-battle evidence. This counts unchanged relic
definitions whose effects actually ran, including their original filters and
conditions. Test cards, unit triggers and carrier subtypes may be authored to
exercise those effects; the claim covers the recorded paths, not every possible
combination. Catalog enumeration and the 26 effect-class candidates do not count
as implemented or validated relics.

All six archives below report game `2.2.1`, module MVID
`8fb07b96-f4db-4d2b-884d-c00536d6ccf4`, `NativeWon=true`, and zero
`CaptureFailures`, `Mismatches`, `Unsupported` and `Pending`. Their current byte
lengths and SHA-256 hashes were checked against [manifest.tsv](manifest.tsv).
The newest batch includes native sampling, independent replay and focused
regression; the older evidence was retained without a new full-inventory run.

| AssetKey | DataId | Accepted archive | Actual effect witness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ExtraSpellCastTrigger` | `410ba540-7c4f-4dc5-a84f-b1d8af508891` | [combined trigger relics][counts] | `IncantTriggers`: 65 player `CardSpellPlayed` queries have `FireCount=2`; five enemy queries remain 1. Full callbacks and the 21-play policy match. |
| `ExtraSpawnTrigger` | `9e0deb69-6196-44a6-8220-85bd0df25f77` | [combined trigger relics][counts] | 26 player `OnSpawn` queries have `FireCount=2`; five enemy queries remain 1. The battle contains new paid unit births. |
| `ExtraDeathTrigger` | `a5d67620-a9ec-4257-91b5-305336e11987` | [combined trigger relics][counts] | 26 player `OnDeath` queries have `FireCount=2`; five enemy queries remain 1. Final `MonstersDeadThisBattle=5` confirms actual deaths. |
| `SpawnWithArmor` | `68ef2523-5c2e-4660-b96d-00b1c0485f54` | [spawn status relics][statuses] | All five player birth records add 5 Armor. Example: `RelicSpawnStatuses[0]`, unit 2, Armor absent → 5. |
| `FirstUnitGainDamageShield` | `60a2a8a3-5f7a-4a9d-b427-5f261145fa1f` | [spawn status relics][statuses] | The first player birth receives 2 Damage Shield on three different turns; two same-turn births skip it. Captured condition counters and turn resets match. |
| `FrostbiteOnEnemies` | `270356af-16bd-4433-a0b2-3e5bb94ef890` | [spawn status relics][statuses] | All seven enemy births receive 2 Frostbite, serialized by the native game as status ID `poison`; player births do not. Example: record 3, unit 5. |
| `ReduceStarterCost` | `d892106c-dbbc-40ac-bf0b-902882cdc69d` | [starter cost relic][cost] | 124 exact manager calls and 49 notifications cover filtering, unique repeat rejection, reset and generated cards. `Actions[0]` actually plays `JustCause` for 1 Ember with base cost 2 and the original `ReduceStarterCost_Upgrade` cost offset −1. |
| `PyreHeartSon` | `8503360a-26b2-4b71-9334-4c6014ad397f` | [cardless relic upgrades][cardless] | Five ordinary cardless births gain +5 attack/+12 health; five cardless clones skip the upgrade. Example: record 8, unit 10, attack 0 → 5 and max health 1 → 13; record 9's clone remains 0/1. |
| `MoltenManifold` | `f141d334-b503-48ff-ac21-5f2ad27105dd` | [original relic batch][batch] | Original `TinkerersToolbelt_Upgrade` contributes `XCost=2`. Sixteen X-cost plays include nine positive payments; 20 damage-scaling witnesses match native values and differ when the relic upgrade is removed. Manager calls also exercise repeat stacking, reset and non-X rejection. |
| `SpawnWithRage` | `55ca34e9-047b-4b93-b390-d8d228a43261` | [original relic batch][batch] | All five player births gain 3 Rage (`buff`). Example: record 0, unit 2, absent → 3. |
| `UnitsGainLifesteal` | `a6b0b657-8893-4cc8-bc62-ec09544c4306` | [original relic batch][batch] | All five player births gain 2 Lifesteal (`lifesteal`). Example: record 0, unit 2, absent → 2. |
| `ContingencyPlans` | `0278309e-d15c-4041-a8dc-b76f360f306b` | [original relic batch][batch] | Two Monstrosity births gain 7 Spikes; the other three player births do not. Records 0–1 accept the authored Monstrosity carrier; record 2 rejects the other carrier. The relic and subtype filter are unchanged. |
| `ImpDamageBuff` | `94595f3a-4624-4408-977d-b166a98f23d2` | [original unit relic batch][units] | Original unique Demon-filtered upgrade adds Multistrike 1. Twenty-seven native exchange observations contain at least two attacks by a Demon carrier, with complete combat state matching. |
| `StewardSacrificeDamage` | `f6a4e405-98b9-4eeb-bae1-50cb204d12ed` | [original unit relic batch][units] | Six original `StewardSacrificeDamageAbility` activations remove their own units; three damage enemies. Three paid source cards exhaust and three cardless source copies retire from ownership. All queued callbacks and physical position changes match. |
| `MorselsGetDamageShield` | `d1daea7e-3346-47df-a756-c839b044e5f3` | [original unit relic batch][units] | Three paid Morsel births retain their starting shield without repeating the spawn effect; three cardless births gain one additional shield. One native exchange consumes a shield while preserving its owner's health. Both original effects and filters remain unchanged. |
| `ValorTransferOnAngelDeath` | `8c493cd7-8048-4598-bdd5-6cc2801cd842` | [original unit relic batch][units] | Twenty-eight native Shift queries cover player 2, enemy body 1, original enemy equipment 2 and excluded trigger 1. Eight player shifts and one equipped-enemy shift double the moved unit's gold callback and match other same-team callbacks. |

Record indices above are zero-based. Full-battle acceptance and independent
effect checks are documented in [README.md](README.md); the table's six source
archives contain these observed battle sizes:

| Archive | Schema | Card plays | EndTurns | Matched stages | Independent relic observations |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| [combined trigger relics][counts] | 108 | 21 | 7 | 62 | 160 trigger-count queries |
| [spawn status relics][statuses] | 109 | 18 | 6 | 52 | 12 birth phases |
| [starter cost relic][cost] | 105 | 18 | 5 | 42 | 124 modifier calls |
| [cardless relic upgrades][cardless] | 111 | 1 | 5 | 42 | 22 birth phases |
| [original relic batch][batch] | 106 | 21 | 5 | 46 | 30 modifier calls, 12 birth phases |
| [original unit relic batch][units] | 106 | 39 | 7 | 56 | 40 modifier calls, 28 Shift queries, 6 original ability activations |

The checks that enforce these observations are
[TriggerCountChecks.Native](../../src/ModelChecks/TriggerCountChecks.cs),
[RelicSpawnStatusChecks.Native](../../src/ModelChecks/RelicSpawnStatusChecks.cs),
[RelicCardModifierChecks.Native](../../src/ModelChecks/RelicCardModifierChecks.cs),
[OriginalRelicBatchChecks.Native](../../src/ModelChecks/OriginalRelicBatchChecks.cs),
and [OriginalUnitRelicBatchChecks.Native](../../src/ModelChecks/OriginalUnitRelicBatchChecks.cs).
The cardless archive uses the clone-birth path in `RelicSpawnStatusChecks.Native`
to compare the complete train, callback queue and dispatched callbacks;
[RelicCardlessUpgradeChecks](../../src/ModelChecks/RelicCardlessUpgradeChecks.cs)
adds focused synthetic checks for its application gates.

No additional original relic is counted for the status, piercing, SelfPurge,
unit-ability, OnKill or conditional modifier fixtures. Their preparation in
[RelicCardModifierScenario](../../src/Probe/RelicCardModifierScenario.cs) replaces
`ReduceStarterCost`'s runtime upgrade or adds a condition. In particular,
`StingBuffPiercing`, `StewardSacrificeDamage_Upgrade` and
`PyreHeartSavagery_UpgradeData` are useful original **payload** evidence, not
validation of their complete original owner relics in those earlier archives.
The new unit relic batch independently validates the unchanged Steward owner.
The ability-Incant fixture's
`PojuNativeAbilityIncantRelic` is authored and is also excluded. The always-present
`PyreHeartStarter_ArtifactData` with an empty effect list adds no effect witness.

The original batch was accepted in commit `63d4f07` with focused regression.
The preceding 210-archive milestone used a passing prefix and a fixed passing
suffix; it is not a fresh full regression on the final batch implementation.
The older `6/224` passage in README describes an earlier milestone; it does not
include the starter-cost, cardless or four-artifact batch evidence above.
