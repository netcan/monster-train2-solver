# Full battle simulation

The objective is an independent simulator for a complete Monster Train 2 battle
from a captured player decision state. The objective is still in progress.
Running the native game to a terminal result is an oracle, not proof that the
independent simulator can finish a battle.

## Current implementation and evidence

The pure `src/Model` library has no Unity or game assembly dependency. Its inputs
are copied immutable values; independent child states can run on worker threads.

| Component | Implementation | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial simple unit play | `SimpleUnitPlayModel` | Native Steward summon, turn zero only |
| Unit and no-target card actions | `BattleActionModel` | Eleven native plays across decision turns and rooms, selected placement, capacity and self-purge |
| Targeted spell actions | `CardSpellModel` | Native damage, last-target follow-ups, valor, pyregel and floor rearrange; independent immunity checks |
| Integer RNG and shuffle | `UnityRng` | 768 native integer draws, seed initialization and complete four-word states |
| Basic draw/discard cycle | `CardCycleModel` | 13 consecutive native operations including reshuffle |
| Room attack exchange | `RoomCombatModel.Exchange` | Ordered initiative, target selection, retargeting, shield/armor and retaliation checks |
| Entire room resolution | `RoomCombatModel.Resolve` | Native normal exchanges, post-combat effects and multiple rounds of boss/Pyre relentless combat |
| Train combat phase | `TrainCombatModel.ResolveCombat` | Top-to-bottom native phase comparison |
| Enemy movement phase | `TrainCombatModel.Ascend` | Native movement and immediate Pyre combat, including the terminal boss fight |
| Unit effects | `CombatTrigger` and `CombatContext` | Generated cards, Battle RNG, treasure escape; gold and once-only trigger checks |
| Card statistics and preview | `BattleStatistics` and `BattlePreviewModel` | Native per-card/Any counters, turn rollover, spawn subtypes, death/exhaust attribution and preview damage statistic |
| Enemy waves and treasure | `EnemySpawningModel` | Native group cache, spawn order, phase, slots and treasure floor selection |
| EndTurn to next decision | `BattleTurnModel.EndTurn` | Seven native consecutive transitions in each supported fixture |
| Battle to terminal result | `BattleSimulator.Resolve` and `ResolveNoMoreCards` | Independent card policies and seven-turn chains, mid-battle inputs and 16 parallel branches |
| Additional spells, abilities, relics | Not complete | Unsupported interactions explicitly reject the model transition |

The game oracle is build 2.2.1, Assembly-CSharp MVID
`8fb07b96-f4db-4d2b-884d-c00536d6ccf4`.

`results/full-battle-steward-once.json` records a seven-decision-turn natural
`Level1BattleJunker` battle, starting with one Steward play. The native game won
with Pyre health 49/80. The independent model matches all 55 room stages, 13
card cycling operations, 14 train phases, 11 wave spawning operations, and seven
EndTurns. Some matched stages are empty rooms; the fixture also includes armor,
spikes, unit death, card generation, treasure escape, and the terminal Pyre boss
fight. There are zero unsupported transitions in this fixture.

`results/full-battle-no-cards.json` is a no-card control with 52 room stages and
the same counts for the other phases. It also reaches native victory with Pyre
health 49/80, with zero differences or unsupported transitions.

The full-chain check supplies the simulator only the first EndTurn input. Every
following decision state and the stopping point come from the independent model;
it never injects later native states, recorded predictions, or a native terminal
turn count. The checker then compares all model decisions and terminal state to
the oracle, and repeats each complete simulation in 16 parallel branches. The Steward fixture
starts after its initial summon has completed; later actions are all EndTurn.

`results/full-battle-units-and-junk.json` adds 11 card plays and 61 room stages.
The policy summons multiple units on different floors, inserts at selected player
positions, and plays generated self-purging junk. It reaches victory at Pyre 60/80
with zero unsupported stages or differences. Its independent chain starts before
the first play and selects every following action from its own state, without
injecting recorded actions or later native states. Every action and EndTurn is
compared to the oracle, with 16 parallel runs and a separate mid-battle root.

`results/full-battle-units-spells-and-junk.json` adds targeted spells to the policy.
All 21 plays, 60 room stages, 13 card-cycle operations, 14 train phases, 11 spawns
and seven EndTurns match the game with zero unsupported stages. The independent
policy reaches native victory at Pyre 73/80, including complete intermediate
comparisons, a mid-battle suffix and 16 parallel branches. It applies the two
starting spells' complete effect sequences: damage followed by pyregel, and
moving the target to the front followed by valor. A killed last target receives
no follow-up status. Valor grants attack immediately and replenishes front armor
after the whole room resolves, once per room resolution; deployment skips the
armor effect. Unit death card routing follows actual combat event order.

`results/full-battle-statistics.json.gz` repeats that policy with schema 5 and
the native card-statistics state included in every room, train, spawn, action
and EndTurn comparison. All 21 plays, 60 room stages, 13 card cycles, 14 train
phases, 11 spawns and seven EndTurns match, with zero unsupported transitions.
The root-only independent policy, mid-battle suffix and 16 parallel branches
also match every decision and the terminal Pyre 73/80. The gzip contains the
unaltered native trace; the checker reads compressed and ordinary JSON fixtures.

Statistics include per-card values for ThisTurn, PreviousTurn and ThisBattle,
ordered played-card history, live played-cost entries, floor/subtype spawn
counts, player deaths, end-turn energy, starting gold and last attack damage.
Capture reads private dictionaries without calling the native statistic getters
that insert zero entries or refresh deck membership. Zero-valued dictionary
entries are canonicalized away; tracked membership includes current owned cards
because the game refreshes this membership before every statistic operation.
Generated cards join that membership and therefore receive later Any counters.

Two native details matter for matching this installed build. Mapped Any counters
increment every tracked card once and the event's source card a second time,
regardless of the original increment amount. UI battle previews also write
LastAttackDamageDealt even though they leave death/exhaust counters alone. The
model simulates preview rooms on independent copies, transfers only that
statistic, and retains the gameplay board, resources, card piles and RNG. The
native probe now waits for PreviewMode to end and pending battle preview changes
to clear before capturing a decision or choosing its next action. Earlier gates
could sample immediately after a spell, while that statistic was still stale.

`BattleActionModel` checks instance identity, energy, enabled floors, Pyre exclusion,
summon capacity and slots, and insertion position. Child states carry spawned
unit/card relationships and all piles into EndTurn. Illegal plays and unsupported
rules have different rejection codes and neither returns a partial child state.
`EnumerateSupportedPlays` enumerates implemented actions; callers must not treat
this list as a certificate that every game action has been covered.

The comparable decision state includes unit identities, health, attack, statuses
and trigger state, unit size and status immunities in newer fixtures; enemy movement and wave cache; every captured gameplay RNG
stream except Chatter and NonDeterministic; hand/draw/discard/standby/exhausted/
purged/eaten/buffer piles; energy, gold, forge points, hoard, and moon phase.
Schema 5 additionally captures unit subtypes, card statistics and whether battle
previews are enabled. Older fixtures omit statistics and do not verify them.
A despawn counter <= 1 is canonicalized to 1 because each value despawns at the
next application. Native UI previews can decrement that private counter below
zero. Longer despawn countdowns are rejected by the native definition capture
until preview effects are modeled.

`results/rule-catalog.json` exports wave candidates, enemy/unit definitions, and
starter/generated card effects, traits and triggers without selecting future
groups. Capture checks that the gameplay RNG streams remain unchanged. The model
inputs embed the resolved wave candidates and rules needed by these fixtures.
Newer inputs also include card play definitions, room capacity/spawn-slot rules,
and armor/valor/pyregel status definitions. `relentless` grants rooted immunity;
live immunity state is preserved when copying, summoning and moving units.

`results/rng-calibration.json` captures six seeds and both RNG values and states,
including signed bounds, the full signed integer span, equal bounds, and reversed
bounds. Sampling restored Unity's process RNG and did not advance the game's
HadesRNG streams. Integer compatibility is verified for this installed build;
floating-point draws are not implemented yet.

Run the saved native oracles without the game:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Check-Models.ps1
```

The checker recomputes each supported model stage and compares it to the captured
native `Actual` state. It does not use the recorded model `Predicted` state as
an oracle. Run a fresh isolated full native battle with:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Run-FullBattleProbe.ps1 -Policy steward-once
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Run-FullBattleProbe.ps1 -Policy no-cards
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Run-FullBattleProbe.ps1 -Policy units-and-junk
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/Run-FullBattleProbe.ps1 -Policy units-spells-and-junk
```

The runner checks the explicit probe success marker, capture failures, pending
records, and differences; a game's process exit code alone does not prove the
probe passed. It hashes original profile files before and after the run. The
checked native runs left those files unchanged. Game copies, isolated profiles,
and locally decompiled reference material are ignored by Git.

## Requirements for completion

1. Capture a self-contained starting battle state and its static rule definitions.
   Include card instance identities, permanent/temporary modifications, card
   statistics, units, statuses, trigger counters, equipment, room state and
   attachments, resources, spawn pattern, boss state, relic internals, delayed
   effects, and every gameplay RNG stream. Do not derive hidden future outcomes
   from a native execution of the candidate being modeled.
2. Apply legal unit plays, targeted spells, equipment, room cards, abilities, and
   follow-up choices to independent child states. Unsupported effects must be
   explicit; a partially applied transition must never become a search node.
3. Implement the complete native EndTurn sequence: pre-discard triggers, hand
   discard and energy handling, room combat, post-combat triggers and status
   clearing, enemy ascension/Pyre encounters, spawning, boss actions, turn
   advancement, energy replenishment, draw, and the next quiet decision point.
4. Continue from that state through the entire battle to victory or defeat,
   including relentless, conditional final bosses, and Pyre destruction or
   resurrection. Distinguish an exact state cycle from an unsupported state.
5. Compare complete decision states and terminal outcomes against the native
   game, using multiple action sequences and mid-run inputs. Check card piles
   and gameplay RNG as well as units, room state and final Pyre health.
6. Verify immutable parent/child isolation and parallel branch determinism.
   Only after state coverage is complete may exact transposition pruning rely
   on the state representation.

The supported initial battle now runs independently to a verified terminal result.
The full objective remains open: additional legal card/ability actions,
additional upgrade internals, statistic-driven scaling and specialized sacrifice mechanics, relics, equipment, room effects, additional statuses and
triggers, boss actions/companions/final bosses, and resurrection are not complete.
Actions now share a state with turn transitions and work at arbitrary decision
turns within the supported rules. Trait/trigger upgrades, statistic-driven effects, equipment
and additional effects are the next steps. Exact pruning still requires
broader state coverage; these fixtures do not establish a simulator for every
Monster Train 2 battle.
